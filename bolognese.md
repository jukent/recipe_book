# Bolognese
## Ingredients
- Onion
- Celery
- Carrot
- 3/4 lbs ground meat (beef, pork, lamb, some combination)
- 1 cup whole milk
- Whole/ground nutmeg
- 1 cup dry wine
- 28 oz. can of whole italian tomatoes
- 1 to 1 1/2 lbs pasta
## Preperation
1. Chop onion, celery, carrot. The amounts of these ingredients can be varied pretty wildly, but you want about 1/2 a cup of each (maybe a little more celery and carrot than onion).
2. Put about 1 tablespoon of vegie oil and 3 tablespoons of butter in a pan and heat. Cook onion till translucent, then add celery and carrot. Get them coated with oil well.
3. Add meat, salt, and pepper. Actively crumble the meat.
4. Once the meat no longer looks raw/red, add milk and let it simmer. Stir frequently.
5. Once the milk has simmered away, add a grating of nutmeg.
6. Add the wine and let it simmer until evaporated.
7. Add those tomatoes (chopped or whole), bring to a lazy simmer.
8. Now let simmer for 3 hours or more. If your tomatoes were whole, break them up once they have cooked a little. Add a little water if the mixture is becoming dry, but let the water simmer away before serving.
9. Cook pasta, add to sauce, serve with parmesan.
